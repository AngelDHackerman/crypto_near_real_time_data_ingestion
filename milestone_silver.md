## 🥈 Milestone: Silver Layer Completed

We officially conclude the **Silver layer** of the pipeline.  

### ✅ Achievements
- Raw JSON data has been successfully transformed into **structured and partitioned Parquet files**.
- Schema is correctly registered in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
- Athena queries now run reliably against the Silver database.
- `ingestion_ts_utc` field has been added to ensure traceability and enable time-based versioning.

### ⚠️ About Duplicates
During validation, we observed **duplicate records** for certain assets and timestamps (mainly around *September 28th–29th*).  
This duplication happened because:
- While the Silver Glue Job was still under development, the same Raw files were **processed more than once**.
- The ingestion strategy is currently **append-only**: every ingestion adds a new version of the data, instead of replacing older ones.

### 📝 Decision
We decided to **keep duplicates in Silver** for now because:
1. Silver is meant to be a **faithful, semi-clean version of Raw** with minimal transformations.  
2. Deduplication is a **business rule**, and therefore belongs in the **Gold layer**, where we will define rules such as:
   - Keeping the latest record per `asset_id` + `event_time_utc` (based on `ingestion_ts_utc`).
   - Or aggregating/averaging values if needed for reporting.

### 🚀 Next Step
Move forward with the **Gold layer**, where we will apply:
- Deduplication rules
- Business logic
- Aggregated metrics  
This will produce **clean, analytics-ready datasets** for Athena, QuickSight, and Machine Learning.
