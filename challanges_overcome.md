## ðŸš§ Challenges Overcome

### 1. Raw Partitioning Strategy (ID â†’ Date)
**Challenge:**  
When designing the raw landing zone, the question was how to partition the files in S3. If we placed dates first and IDs second, querying a single asset (e.g., BTC) required scanning many folders and wasted resources.

**Solution:**  
Partition the raw data by `id` first and then by `year/month/day/hour`:

`s3://.../bronze/id=1/year=2025/month=09/day=28/hour=03/part-*.json`


**Impact:**  
- Easy isolation of each asset.  
- Optimized scans in Athena/Glue when filtering by a specific `asset_id`.  
- Preserved hourly granularity for time-series analysis.
